    prompt: can you make a perfec javadocs for me and give me the template
    result:
    Absolutely—here’s a clean, copy-pasteable JavaDoc starter kit plus quick rules so your docs look “HD-ready” for marking and teammates.
    Quick rules for “perfect” JavaDocs
    Write what it does first, then why, then any gotchas.
    Use {@code ...} for code literals and {@link Type#member} for links.
    Document every public type/member; inherit with {@inheritDoc} where appropriate.
    Prefer @apiNote, @implSpec, @implNote for deeper context.
    Keep first sentence a single-line summary (ends with a period) → used in indexes.
    Order tags: @param (alphabetical), @return, @throws, @since, @see.

    Tag cheat-sheet
    @param name description
    @return description
    @throws Type reason
    @since version
    @see Type#member or URL
    @deprecated reason and replacement
    @apiNote (how to use), @implSpec (contract for implementors), @implNote (implementation details)

    prompt:/src/builder/entities/npc/spawners/BeeHiveSpawner.java:19:17: Member name 'x' must match pattern '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]$'. [MemberName] how to fix the error like this?
    result:
    hat error is from Checkstyle’s MemberName rule. Your field is named x, but your project’s rule requires names to match this regex:

^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]$


Notice there’s no * at the end—so it only allows exactly two characters: one lowercase letter followed by one alphanumeric. A single-letter name like x won’t pass.

You have two ways to fix it—pick the one your course/repo allows:

Option A — Rename the field to two characters

Rename x to something like x0, x1, or xa and update all references.

// before
private int x;

// after (and update all usages)
private int x0;


In IntelliJ: right-click the field → Refactor → Rename… (Shift+F6) → type x0 → “Search in comments and strings” off, “Search for text occurrences” off → Do Refactor.

Do the same for y if you have it.

Option B — Fix the (likely mistaken) regex in Checkstyle

Most style guides allow any length in lowerCamelCase, i.e. ^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$.
If you’re allowed to edit checkstyle.xml, change:

<Property name="format" value="^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]$"/>


to

<Property name="format" value="^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$"/>


Then you can keep meaningful names like x, xCoord, beeCount, etc.
